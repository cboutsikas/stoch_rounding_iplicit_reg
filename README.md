# stoch_rounding_iplicit_reg
### Repository Description:
Î¤his repository contains the code for reproducing the results presented in the paper titled  [Stochastic rounding implicity regularizes tall-and-thin matices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12278). The purpose is to generate tall_and_thin matrices while controling specific properties discussed in Section 5 of the paper, and subsequently to compute the smallest singular values of the stochastically rounded matrices. If you wish to reproduce the exact same size combinations as those in the paper, ensure you have sufficient memory resources. Otherwise, you can modify the size variables accordingly. Please review the comments at the beginning of each script before executing.



### Installation Requirements:
- Ensure you have Julia installed for performing major computations.
- The [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) is required for merging some of the plots. Once you have it installed, make sure that the executable is being in yout system's PATH.
