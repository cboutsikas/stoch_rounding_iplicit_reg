# stoch_rounding_iplicit_reg
### Repository Description:
Î¤his repository contains the code for reproducing the results presented in the paper titled  [Stochastic rounding implicity regularizes tall-and-thin matices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12278). The purpose of this repository is to generate tall_and_thin matrices while controling some properties of interest, as discussed in the Section 5 of the paper. Each one of the scripts, correspond to the results of the sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 respectively. If you wish to reproduce the exact same size combinations with the ones from the paper, make sure that you run on a cimputer that has adequate memory requirements. Otherwise, you can modify the size variables accordingly. Please read carefully the comments on the each script before executing it.



### Installation Requirements:
- Ensure you have Julia installed for performing major computations.
- The [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) is required for merging some of the plots. Once you have it installed, make sure that the executable is being in yout system's PATH.

Before running the scripts, please review the description at the beginning of each code.
